INSTALLATION

    Method 1
    Download the zipped tar file from one of the following:
        http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Spreadsheet-WriteExcel
        http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/mod_perl/cpan-search?idinfo=154
        ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/CPAN/authors/id/J/JM/JMCNAMARA/
        
    Unzip the module as follows or use winzip:
           tar -zxvf Spreadsheet-WriteExcel-0.xx.tar.gz

    The module can be installed using the standard Perl procedure:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install    # You may need to be root
        make clean      # or make realclean

    Windows users without a working "make" can get nmake from:
        ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/nmake15.exe

    Method 2
    If you have CPAN.pm configured you can install the module as
    follows:
        perl -MCPAN -e "install 'Spreadsheet::WriteExcel'"

    Method 3
    ActivePerl users can use PPM as follows:

        C:\> ppm
        PPM> set repository tmp http://homepage.eircom.net/~jmcnamara/perl
        PPM> install Spreadsheet-WriteExcel
        PPM> quit
        C:\>

        If this fails try the following:

        PPM>install http://homepage.eircom.net/~jmcnamara/perl/Spreadsheet-WriteExcel.ppd

    If you wish to perform a local PPM install you can get the files
    from (xx is the version number):
        http://homepage.eircom.net/~jmcnamara/perl/Spreadsheet-WriteExcel.ppd
