NAME

    Spreadsheet::WriteExcel - Write formatted text and numbers to a 
    cross-platform Excel binary file.

======================================================================
DESCRIPTION

    The Spreadsheet::WriteExcel module can be used to create a cross-
    platform Excel binary file. Multiple worksheets can be added to a
    workbook and formatting can be applied to cells. Text, numbers,
    formulas and hyperlinks can be written to the cells.

    The Excel file produced by this module is compatible with Excel 5,
    95, 97 and 2000.

    The module will work on the majority of Windows, UNIX and
    Macintosh platforms. Generated files are also compatible with the
    Linux/UNIX spreadsheet applications OpenOffice, Gnumeric and XESS.
    The generated files are not compatible with MS Access.

    This module cannot be used to read an Excel file. See
    Spreadsheet::ParseExcel or look at the main documentation for some
    suggestions. This module cannot be uses to write to an existing
    Excel file.

SYNOPSIS

    To write a string, a formatted string, a number and a formula to
    the first worksheet in an Excel workbook called perl.xls:

        use Spreadsheet::WriteExcel;

        # Create a new Excel workbook
        my $workbook = Spreadsheet::WriteExcel->new("perl.xls");

        # Add a worksheet
        $worksheet = $workbook->addworksheet();

        #  Add and define a format
        $format = $workbook->addformat();    # Add a format
        $format->set_bold();
        $format->set_color('red');
        $format->set_align('center');

        # Write a formatted and unformatted string, row and column notation.
        $col = $row = 0;
        $worksheet->write($row, $col, "Hi Excel!", $format);
        $worksheet->write(1,    $col, "Hi Excel!");

        # Write a number and a formula using A1 notation
        $worksheet->write('A3', 1.2345);
        $worksheet->write('A4', '=SIN(PI()/4)');

INSTALLATION

    Method 1
    Download the zipped tar file from one of the following:
        http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Spreadsheet-WriteExcel
        http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/mod_perl/cpan-search?idinfo=154
        ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/CPAN/authors/id/J/JM/JMCNAMARA/
        
    Unzip the module as follows or use winzip:
           tar -zxvf Spreadsheet-WriteExcel-0.xx.tar.gz

    The module can be installed using the standard Perl procedure:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install    # You may need to be root
        make clean      # or make realclean

    Windows users without a working "make" can get nmake from:
        ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/nmake15.exe

    Method 2
    If you have CPAN.pm configured you can install the module as
    follows:
        perl -MCPAN -e "install 'Spreadsheet::WriteExcel'"

    Method 3
    ActivePerl users can use PPM as follows:

        C:\> ppm
        PPM> set repository tmp http://homepage.eircom.net/~jmcnamara/perl
        PPM> install Spreadsheet-WriteExcel
        PPM> quit
        C:\>

        If this fails try the following:

        PPM>install http://homepage.eircom.net/~jmcnamara/perl/Spreadsheet-WriteExcel.ppd

    If you wish to perform a local PPM install you can get the files
    from:
        http://homepage.eircom.net/~jmcnamara/perl/Spreadsheet-WriteExcel.ppd
        http://homepage.eircom.net/~jmcnamara/perl/Spreadsheet-WriteExcel-0.xx-PPM.tar.gz
