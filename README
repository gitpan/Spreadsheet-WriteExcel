NAME
    Spreadsheet::WriteExcel - Write formatted text and numbers to a 
    cross-platform Excel binary file.

DESCRIPTION
    This module can be used to write numbers and text in the native
    Excel binary file format. Multiple worksheets can be added to a
    workbook. Formatting can be applied to cells.

    The Excel file produced by this module is compatible with Excel 5,
    95, 97 and 2000.

    The module will work on the majority of Windows, UNIX and
    Macintosh platforms. Generated files are also compatible with the
    Linux/UNIX spreadsheet applications Star Office, Gnumeric and
    XESS. The generated files are not compatible with MS Access.

    This module cannot be used to read an Excel file. See
