NAME
    Spreadsheet::WriteExcel - Write text and numbers to minimal
    Excel binary file.

DESCRIPTION
    This module can be used to write numbers and text in the native
    Excel binary file format. This is a minimal implementation of an
    Excel file; no formatting can be applied to cells and only a
    single worksheet can be written to a workbook.
    
    This module cannot be used to read an Excel file. Look at the main
    documentation for some suggestions.

    This module is intended to be cross-platform, however, this is 
    not guaranteed. See the section on portability in the main
    documentation.

INSTALLATION
