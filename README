NAME
    Spreadsheet::WriteExcel - Write formatted text and numbers to a 
    cross-platform Excel binary file.


DESCRIPTION
    This module can be used to write numbers and text in the native
    Excel binary file format. Multiple worksheets can be added to a
    workbook. Formatting can be applied to cells.

    The Excel file produced by this module is compatible with Excel 5,
    95, 97 and 2000.

    The module will work on the majority of Windows, UNIX and
    Macintosh platforms. Generated files are also compatible with the
    Linux/UNIX spreadsheet applications Star Office, Gnumeric and
    XESS. The generated files are not compatible with MS Access.

    This module cannot be used to read an Excel file. See
    Spreadsheet::ParseExcel or look at the main documentation for some
    suggestions.


SYNOPSIS
    To write a string, a number and a formatted string to the first 
    worksheet in an Excel workbook called perl.xls:

    use Spreadsheet::WriteExcel;

    $row1 = $col1 = 0;
    $row2 = 1;
    $row3 = 2;

    my $workbook = Spreadsheet::WriteExcel->new("perl.xls");
    $worksheet   = $workbook->addworksheet();
    $format      = $workbook->addformat();
    
    $format->set_bold();
    $format->set_color('red');
    $format->set_align('center');

    $worksheet->write($row1, $col1, "Hi Excel!");
    $worksheet->write($row2, $col1, 1.2345);
    $worksheet->write($row3, $col1, "Hi Excel!", $format);


INSTALLATION
    Method 1
    Download the zipped tar file from:
        http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Spreadsheet-WriteExcel

    Unzip the module as follows or use winzip:
           tar -zxvf Spreadsheet-WriteExcel-0.xx.tar.gz

    The module can be installed using the standard Perl procedure:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install    # You may need to be root
        make clean      # or make realclean

    Windows users without a working "make" can get nmake from:
        ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/nmake15.exe

    Method 2
    If you have CPAN.pm configured you can install the module as
    follows:
        perl -MCPAN -e "install 'Spreadsheet-WriteExcel'"

    Method 3
    ActivePerl users can use PPM as follows:

        C:\> ppm
        PPM> set repository tmp http://homepage.eircom.net/~jmcnamara/perl
        PPM> install Spreadsheet-WriteExcel
        PPM> quit
        C:\>

        If this fails try the following:

        PPM>install http://homepage.eircom.net/~jmcnamara/perl/Spreadsheet-WriteExcel.ppd


    NOTE: Version 0.23 changed the WriteExcel namespace. To tidy up 
    stray files it would be best to uninstall any version older than
    this prior to installation.
