NAME
    Spreadsheet::WriteExcel - Write text and numbers to minimal
    Excel binary file.

DESCRIPTION
    This module can be used to write numbers and text in the native
    Excel binary file format. This is a minimal implementation of an
    Excel file; no formatting can be applied to cells and only a
    single worksheet can be written to a workbook.

    It is intended to be cross-platform, however, this is not
    guaranteed. See the section on portability in the main
    documentation.

VERSION
    This document refers to version 0.08 of Spreadsheet::WriteExcel,
    released Jan 16, 2000.
